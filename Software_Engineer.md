# Software Engineer (Data Science Products)

GovTech's Data Science team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore.

## What the role is

As a software engineer, you will:

- Build prototypes to demostrate technology opportunities
- Design system architectures
- Write production quality code, and
- Manage deployments to cloud and (occasionally) on-premise infrastructure
- Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team.

Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:

- Establish best practices
- Share your expertise and mentor other engineers
- Help with recruiting.

You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. 

Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value. 

## What it is like working here

You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. 

- **Rapid Prototyping** - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily. 
- **Ownership** - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. 
- **Continuous Learning** - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential. 

## What we are looking for

We work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. However, we do not require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us. 

We look for people who:

- Have a demonstrated ability to build software
- Can write code to solve abstract problems
- Can talk and reason about code with other engineers
- Have an interest in data science and machine learning
- Take the initiative to make things happen
- Want to work for the public good.
